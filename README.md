Log File: All keystrokes are saved in a file named key_log.txt. You can modify this to another location or filename if desired.
Logging Keystrokes: The program captures all keypresses, appends them to a list, and writes them to the log file.
Handling Special Keys: Special keys like space, enter, and backspace are handled separately for better readability in the log file.
Stop Keylogging: The keylogger can be stopped by pressing the Esc key, at which point the program exits.
